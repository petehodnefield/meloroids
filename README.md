# Meloroids

## Motivation

As a Web Developer with a background in Music Production, I realized a lot of overlap between objects and songs. It became clear to me that songs are objects containing properties such as keys, tempos, chord progressions.
Meloroids currently has features focused on solving trivial, repetitive tasks music producers face everytime they write music. Artist Target, Target, and Quickie are features that automate coming up with a name for your music file, as well as providing parameters, such as chord progressions, keys, and tempos, for the music producer to write with.

### Technologies Used

- React.js
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB
- Apollo
- GraphQL
- JWT
- SendGrid

### Future Development

I hope to add several social features to Meloroids. One such idea is for producers to be able to upload melodies they write using the tools of Meloroids and have a sort of community where producers can rate each other's Melodies and gain points.
